=head1 NAME

Device::MindWave

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Device::MindWave;

    my $mw = Device::MindWave->new(port => '/dev/ttyUSB0');
    $mw->auto_connect();
    while (my $packet = $mw->read_packet()) {
        print $packet->as_string(),"\n";
    }
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides for connecting to and disconnecting from a NeuroSky MindWave
headset, as well as reading and parsing the data that it produces.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item B<new>

Arguments (hash):

=over 8

=item port

The port name (e.g. 'COM4', '/dev/ttyUSB0').

=item fh

An object representing the MindWave. Must implement C<read> and
C<write>, as per L<IO::Handle>. This library will not reattempt
C<read>s on the filehandle if fewer characters than requested are
returned.

=back

One of C<port> and C<fh> must be provided. Returns a new instance of
L<Device::MindWave>.

=back

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=over 4

=item B<connect_nb>

Takes a headset ID as its argument, sends a message to the dongle to
connect to that headset, and returns immediately. The caller must use
C<read_packet> to determine whether the connection was made
successfully.

The headset ID can be provided as either one 16-bit number or two
8-bit numbers in network byte order. For example, if the headset has
the ID '12AB', then the argument can be C<0x12AB>, or C<0x12> and
C<0xAB>. (The identifier is printed at the bottom of the label inside
the battery compartment.)

=item B<connect>

As per C<connect_nb>, except that it blocks until either the
connection is successfully established or an error occurs (e.g.
request denied by dongle due to existing connection). Dies on error.

=item B<auto_connect_nb>

As per C<connect_nb>, except that it does not take any arguments and
the dongle message is such that it will attempt to connect to any
headset within range.

=item B<auto_connect>

As per C<connect>, except for C<auto_connect_nb>.

=item B<disconnect_nb>

Sends a message to the dongle to disconnect from the headset. The
caller must use C<read_packet> to determine whether the connection was
closed successfully.

=item B<disconnect>

As per C<disconnect_nb>, except that it blocks until either the
connection is closed or an error occurs (e.g. request denied by dongle
because it is not currently connected to a headset). Dies on error.

=item B<read_packet>

Attempts to parse and return a packet from the dongle. The returned
packet objects implement L<Device::MindWave::Packet>. If a checksum
error is encountered, then the read operation is retried; otherwise,
this dies on error. By default, the read timeout is one second.

When not connected to a headset, this method will return dongle
communication protocol packets. Each of these implements the
L<Device::MindWave::Packet::Dongle> interface. When connected to a
headset, this method will return ThinkGear packets: see
L<Device::MindWave::Packet::ThinkGear>.
